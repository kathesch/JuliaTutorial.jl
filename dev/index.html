The aim of this page is to get you quickly started with the Julia programming language.</p><p>I think Julia is perhaps the most productive gateway to the world of numerical methods for scientific computing, and I hope this can be a self-contained resource to get you started with Julia, its ecosystem, and exploring numerical methods.</p><p>!!! note What is Julia and why should you learn it</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">Julia is a scientific programming language comparable to python, matlab, fortran, and R. It was originally created in 2012 by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah (and others) in the MIT Computational Science and Aritifical Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) as an open source project. 

Since then, the language has amassed 8000 officially registered packages and become a dominant language for instruction and research in applied math departments at several top research universities, notably MIT and Stanford[]. The Julia community is still small compared to python, but in its niche of numerical computing, it is already very well established. 

The primary purpose for creating Julia was solving the &quot;two language problem&quot;. This is where a scientific programmer implementing complex algorithms in high-level/abstract languages (commonly python) must then convert or interface this code to a low-level/systems language (commonly C++/fortran) in order to get efficient performance. 

Practically speaking, the two language problem means scientists must use C++/fortran (with all their many headaches) to get high performance software or else hope that someone else wrote something relevant in C++/fortran and made a convenient python interface for it such as numpy or scipy.

Julia has arguably solved this problem through JIT (just-in-time) compilation along with host of other design decisions which enable a python-like syntax, but with the capability of C++/fortran speeds. This means we can make, for instance, a linear algebra package in pure Julia and have it run as fast (or sometimes faster[]) than C++/fortran ones such as openBLAS.

This does come at the cost - mostly in added precompilation time when a function is first called. But I believe it is well worth it for most use cases in scientific computing.</code></pre><h1 id="Installation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Installation">Installation</a><a id="Installation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Installation" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>Julia can be installed from its <a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">official download page</a>.</p><p>It can also be installed via homebrew (on macs).

julia&gt; print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
hello world</code></pre><p>The REPL is a great interface for using Julia quickly (to make a quick plot, overview your packages, or do a quick calculation), but we will need a robust IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write more complex code. There are many IDE&#39;s for various programming languages including Julia, but the easiest and most fully featured one for Julia is VS Code which we will install in the next section. </p><p>!!! note On Julia versions</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">Julia, like most actively used software, is under a constant state of development. This means you will find various older and newer versions of Julia out in the wild. These versions are distinguished by a version number, for example, 1.8.1 or 0.7.2. 

This release scheme is very common in open source software (know as the [semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org)). The first number indicates a major release. For Julia this was the 1.0.0 release in 2018. 1.0.0 is considered a major milestone for open source development as it typically represents a commitment to major design decisions in the software and a certain amount of stability to what its interface looks like.

The following two numbers are respectively a minor release and patch number. Minor releases are usually every 4-5 months. And patches are released as needed. You can read more about Julia&#39;s release process [here](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/08/release-process/#minor_releases).

Typically, Julia code written for 1.0.0 will work if run by later versions of Julia (this is known as backwards compatability). However code written for a newer Julia version cannot be assumed to run on an earlier Julia version i.e. it is not forward compatible. This is usually because it incorporates language features which are not parseable by earlier Julia versions.

Practically speaking, if you keep Julia updated to the current stable release, you won&#39;t run into version issues, but if you find yourself needing to use many different versions of Julia, for instance, if you want to test the latest releases or want to use a very old package, you can use the [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) tool to quickly and conveniently manage many different Julia versions.</code></pre><h1 id="Using-Julia-in-VS-Code"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Using-Julia-in-VS-Code">Using Julia in VS Code</a><a id="Using-Julia-in-VS-Code-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Using-Julia-in-VS-Code" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>VS Code can be installed from its <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">official download page</a>.</p><p>It can also be installed via homebrew (on macs) by pasting the following command into a terminal.</p><p><code>brew install --cask visual-studio-code</code></p><p>You can then open VS Code by typing <code>code</code> into a terminal. </p><p>The julia extension can be install by clicking the following extension button in the upper left of VS Code.</p><p><img src="2022-09-26-14-51-45.png" alt/></p><p>Search for &quot;julia&quot;, and then click the blue install button.  &lt;img src=&quot;2022-09-26-15-00-34.png&quot; width=200/&gt;</p><p>Next, let&#39;s make a .jl file to edit.

It&#39;s most powerful features for Julia programming are:

* An &quot;extension marketplace&quot; where you can install extensions to the IDE which give it support for various programming languages, color schemes and syntax highlighting, quality of life tools, and many others. 

* Git integration which lets you quickly and seamlessly push commits to a remote git repository.

* Remote development support which lets you develop and run code on other computers with nearly exactly the same workflow as your local machine. This is *very* convenient for working on cloud computing tools like AWS&#39;s EC2 as well as more traditional high performance computing infrastructure.</code></pre><h1 id="Writing-simple-Julia-programs"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Writing-simple-Julia-programs">Writing simple Julia programs</a><a id="Writing-simple-Julia-programs-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Writing-simple-Julia-programs" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>Out-of-the-box, we can already do quite a lot with Julia. </p><p>Let&#39;s write a simple program.
